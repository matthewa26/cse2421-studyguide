## Practice Problems
For practice problems, it would help to have a driver program to save time. Here is an example of a driver program you could use:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    /* variable declarations here */
    /* int foo = 0; */
    
    /* function calls here */
    /* foo = bar(foo);
    
    /* verify results here */
    printf("Expected %i, received %i", 1, foo);
    
    return 0;
}
```
